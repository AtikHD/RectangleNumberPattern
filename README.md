### Extended Description:

This program provides an introduction to Java loops and console input by printing a simple rectangle pattern of numbers. The user inputs the rectangle’s length and width, and the program outputs rows containing sequential numbers from 1 up to the length, repeated for the specified number of rows.

It demonstrates:

- Usage of nested loops for pattern creation
- Handling user input with the `Scanner` class
- Basic control flow with counters and loop limits

This straightforward project is a good starting point for beginners to understand loops and pattern printing in Java.
